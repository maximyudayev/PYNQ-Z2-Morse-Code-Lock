# HVAC Remote Monitoring System
The repository contains the Vivado project with VHDL source code for the Morse code lock lab assignment of the Digital Systems course at KU Leuven - Campus GroupT in academic year 2019-2020, taught by the awesome Yuri :wink:

## Description
Change the binary sequence representing your initials in Morse code in the Lab4_MaximYudayev/MORSE_CODE/MORSE_CODE.srcs/sources_1/new/morsecodelockMY.vhd file according to the comments. If you enter a correct sequence, the Green light will turn on and let you in, otherwise a Purple light will turn on and tell you to go away while you still can.

## Demo
